 description: This data model is catered for drinkingwater treatment related models and simulations as part of the EU project 
  called ToDrinQ. In this project, softsensors and modular complementary and innovative didgtal solutions are developed for the purpose of
  providing critical information and decision support tools to operators and designers to adapt to short term and long term changes in water quality and their influence in drinking water treamtent systems
